    <h1>Nick Steinmetz's Biography</h1>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Nick Steinmetz, an Inofrmation Management and Technology major at Syracuse University.  I am in the class of 2024 and plan to concentrate in web design and data analytics.  This summer I did an internship with a startup in Cape Town, South Africa, working with python to help them with data clusters.

    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>
        Besides work, <strong>photography</strong> is one of my main hobbies.  I have been inspired by my dad who is a photographer himself and he has helped me start my own little drone photography business photographing houses with a drone for reality.  Other than that I like to have fun with friends and family by watching movies or playing games.

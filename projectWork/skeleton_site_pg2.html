            <div class="oLetter">O</div>ur involvement in aerial photography began when we went on helicopter flights with our father, George Steinmetz, who is an aerial photographer working for National Geographic. Three years ago, we started photographing homes around our neighborhood in Glen Ridge, New Jersey, for a project with the Glen Ridge Historical Society to document all of the town's homes. For the past three summers, we have photographed a total of 400 houses, and gained a lot of experience in aerial real estate photography.

                We both have earned our unmanned aircraft license from the FAA. This has opened our business up to commercial opportunities including photography for private use and in the real estate industry. Although our specialty is still photos, Nick has a lot of experience with drone videography, mainly from being an assistant on his trips with his father.
